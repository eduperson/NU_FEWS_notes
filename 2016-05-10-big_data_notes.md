Abstract
========

Introduction
============

NOTES
=====
must have clear need and potential sections in proposal
must make distinction with modeling
in order to succeed, the proposal must grab the reader and be different.  What specific things about our group can make this happen?

model building, closed system model building

open ended hypotheses versus

intelligent irrigation systems

fungal hyphae to reduce water evaporation, reduce soil loss, and reduce weed introduction

Pluses
======
1. Excellent Model!
2. Great team with expertise
3. Important need
4. A holistic model for the use of big data
5. Seeks to optimize FEWS outputs using big data
6. Lots of good measurements
7. Uses big data to address system processes
8. offers new ways to interrelate data
9. Novel ways to organize collections of data
10. Ambitious project
11. Systematic description of nutrient and water cycles
12. Will be a great tool to evaluate models
13. Promise to provide a lot of information which would lead to food security
14. Strong computer science and data analysis component
15. Integrates all components of FEWS funding application
16. Consolidates big data and infrastructure science expertise missing at UNL
17. Nice integration of processes
18. Hybrid data and modeling aspect seems unique
19. Big dat has the potential for dynamic real-time descision making

Potentials
==========
1. If applied to a singular problem or question, could produce information for efficient systems
2. Could be applied to all crops
3. Could be applied to develop other uses of corn
4. Exciting potential for optimization and real-time control of system
5. Brings together broad interests to focus on integrated analysis
6. great potential and benefit
7. Potential to be applied to being used with other crops
8. Could be used to model other crops, trees, and animals, etc.
9. Measuring could be used for benchmarks and monitoring
10. Ideas potentially identify gaps in novel information base
11. Answer questions we don't know yet and integrates questions from many research groups.
12. We can learn a great deal if we can make the system optimal
13. Has the potential to influence policy and provide an Agriculatural Management tool.

Concerns
========
1. What is the core research challenge?
2. What is the scale of the analysis?
3. How will data be collected?
4. Is the existing data good enough?
5. How would new data be analyzed?
6. How do you weight the edges of your model?
7. What is the value judgment placed on the output data?
8. What are the details (soil issues, input issues, economic issues) that need to be worked out before we can understand the system?
9. How does this differ from previous work such as the integration of databases?
10. How do we integrate global crop systems with data from United States models?
11. How would you simplify the complexity of the models?
12. How will you make this project less risky?
13. How is this project novel with regard to climate change and water usage?
14. How will stream water be addressed?
15. How to avoid relatively minor flaws of water and nutrients?
16. Who has access to the information provided by the models?
17. How do you use information from modellers?
18. How can you develop the information from your system into useable tools for farmers, policy makers, and the public?
19. What is the practical application to solve immediate challenges?
20. How do you define the types of data needed?
21. How will you reduce the amount of energy used in the system?
22. How do you know you're collecting the correct data?
23. What is the novelty to the proposed system?
24. Where does the other uses of crop waste (i.e. grazing crops, corn residue, cover crops) fit in?
25. How do you make this project one that would be funded by NSF or USDA?

Overcomes
=========
1. Link with other groups on data sharing and FEWS model development


==============================================================

[meeting website](https://sites.google.com/site/2016dsfew/)

We solicit 3 different types of papers on topics relevant to the workshop theme: research paper (long), on-going-work paper (short), position or vision paper.

The topics of interest include the following three categories: 1. Data scientific agenda for each of the three resources; 2. Issues arising in the interactions of two or more of them; and 3. Foundational agenda that are common to them.

Topics in the first category may include: Crop science, yield modeling, genotype phenotype analysis, genotype vs. environment (GxE) analysis, automated phenotyping, disease dispersion modeling, impact analysis of farming practices (e.g. tillage) on sustainable agriculture (in Food); Solar irradiance forecasting, weather forecasting for power outage prediction and power grid management, utility demand and price forecasting, air pollution modeling and source identification (in Energy); Weather and drought forecasting, water logging, water run-off modeling and water pollution modeling (in Water).

Topics in the second category may include: Crop genotype phenotype analysis for biofuel production, crop production modeling with economic considerations (in Food/Energy); Modeling water contamination by fertilizer, analyzing effect of organic farming on water quality, integrated management of land and water (in Food/Water); Analysis of electricity use in irrigation, analysis of energy consumption in fertilizer and pesticide production, analysis of environmental impact of energy production, e.g. water temperature (in Energy/Water); Assessment of environmental impact through product life-cycle, system integration challenges for eco-system services, integrated water resource management and planning, understanding impact of climate change on FEW systems, identifying wastes and losses in FEW systems (in Food/Energy/Water).

Topics in the third category may include: Big geo-spatial data management, spatial temporal data analytics, integrated physical and statistical modeling and data assimilation, image and hyperspectral data analytics, multi-scale, multi-resolution, multi-sensor data analytics, robust and heterogeneous data modeling, extreme event and anomaly detection for system security, etc.
